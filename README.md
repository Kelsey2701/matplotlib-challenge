Key findings include the summary statistics for each drug regimen, the distribution of male and female mice, the identification of potential outliers, and the visualization of the relationships between variables through plots and regression analysis. These findings can help inform further research and decision-making in the pharmaceutical company's efforts to develop anti-cancer medications. It appears that Capomulin and Ramicane are the most effective.
